- `GeneID`: The identifier that is assigned to the gene, and is species-specific. There are 16148 raws of them in this dataset.

- `CTRL_1` , `CTRL_2`, `CTRL_3`, `CTRL_4`, `CTRL_5`, `CTRL_6`: Control patients (no Parkinson). There are 6 (columns) of them, each data point represents the amount of protein level transcribed in the sample from to the corresponding gene (raws).

- `PD_1`, `PD_2`, `PD_3`, `PD_4`, `PD_5`, `PD_6`, `PD_7`, `PD_8`: Parkinson's patients. There are 8 (columns) of them, each data point represents the amount of protein level transcribed in the sample from to the corresponding gene (raws).

A document with more details and information about the protocols and names of the specific procedures, which came with the dataset and is not relevant to my project. Since I am taking the dataset from the open data source, I kept it.
